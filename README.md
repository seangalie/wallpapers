<!-- TEMPLATE-SETUP:START -->
> ### 🧰 You are looking at a template repository
>
> Press **Use this template** to create your own repository from it. On the first
> push to `main`, the [Template Bootstrap](.github/workflows/template-bootstrap.yml)
> workflow replaces the `GITHUB_USERNAME`, `REPO_SLUG`, `PROJECT_NAME`, and
> `FULL_NAME` placeholders across every file, strips the template notices, opens a
> checklist issue covering the parts that still need a human, applies the
> labels from `.github/labels.yml`.
>
> It commits directly when repository rules allow that; otherwise it preserves
> the changes on a setup branch and opens a pull request, and if repository
> policy blocks automated pull requests too, the checklist issue links to that
> branch. It also tries to delete its own workflow files, but GitHub normally
> refuses to let `GITHUB_TOKEN` write under `.github/workflows`, so expect a
> comment on the checklist issue asking you to delete `template-bootstrap.yml`
> and `template-test.yml` by hand. They are harmless until you do: once the
> personalization lands, the bootstrap finds nothing left to change.
>
> If it did not run, start it by hand from **Actions → Template Bootstrap → Run
> workflow**.

> <summary>Setting up without GitHub Actions</summary>
>
> From a clone of the new repository, with Bash and Perl available:
>
> 1. Run the file edits the workflow would make. They replace the placeholders,
>    write `.github/CODEOWNERS`, and remove every template notice, including
>    this one. Use `OWNER_TYPE=Organization` for an organization account.
>
>    ```sh
>    OWNER=your-login REPO=your-repo FULL_NAME="Your Name" OWNER_TYPE=User \
>      bash .github/scripts/template-bootstrap.sh
>    ```
>
> 2. Open an issue from `.github/TEMPLATE_CHECKLIST.md` (or keep it as your own
>    to-do list), then delete the template-only files:
>
>    ```sh
>    git rm -r .github/TEMPLATE_CHECKLIST.md .github/scripts \
>      .github/workflows/template-bootstrap.yml .github/workflows/template-test.yml
>    ```
>
> 3. Commit and push. This commit does not touch `.github/labels.yml`, so the
>    Sync labels workflow will not start by itself: run it once from **Actions →
>    Sync labels → Run workflow** to create the labels the PR Labels check needs.
>
> Deleting `template-bootstrap.yml` is what stops it running on every push, so
> do not skip step 2.
