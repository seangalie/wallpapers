The Template Bootstrap workflow has filled in the repository name, owner, and
author placeholders. The items below still need a human.

### Content

- [ ] Set a human-readable project title in `README.md`. The bootstrap uses the repository slug, so a repo named `my-cool-thing` currently has that as its heading.
- [ ] Write the tagline under the project title in `README.md`.
- [ ] Replace every `> **[?]**` prompt in `README.md` (About, Screenshots, Built With, Prerequisites, Installation, Usage, Support, Acknowledgements). Delete any section that does not apply, such as Screenshots for a library.
- [ ] Fill in the development environment steps in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, replacing the `2. TODO` step.
- [ ] Replace every `> **[?]**` prompt in `AGENTS.md` (overview, commands, layout, code style, boundaries). `CLAUDE.md` imports it, so leave that file as it is.
- [ ] Replace `docs/logo.svg` and `docs/screenshot.png`.
- [ ] Start filling in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] Replace the placeholder step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with this project's real build and test steps.

### Contact and policy

- [ ] In `docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, replace the `[NOTE: describe your means of reporting here.]` placeholder with a real contact method, and either adopt the enforcement ladder under **Addressing and Repairing Harm** or replace it with your own, then delete the `[NOTE: ...]` paragraph above it.
- [ ] In `docs/SECURITY.md`, update the supported-versions table and replace or delete both `> **[?]**` prompts: the table's, and the one offering an email address for reports.
- [ ] Add your copyright notice using the appendix at the end of `LICENSE` — in source headers or a `NOTICE` file. Leave the license text itself unmodified.

### Repository settings

- [ ] Set the repository description and topics — they drive GitHub search and the social card.
- [ ] Enable **Discussions** (the README and the issue chooser both link to it).
- [ ] Enable **Private vulnerability reporting** under Settings → Security.
- [ ] Review `.github/CODEOWNERS`. Personal repositories get the owner account automatically; organization repositories must replace and uncomment the `@org/team-name` example, and that team needs write access before GitHub will honor it.
- [ ] Confirm the labels from `.github/labels.yml` were applied. The bootstrap starts the **Sync labels** workflow; if it did not run, start it from the Actions tab. The **PR Labels** check fails until those labels exist.
- [ ] Set up branch protection or a ruleset on the default branch, and require the **🧪 Build and test** and **🏭 Verify** (PR Labels) checks once CI does real work. If you require pull requests, also enable Settings → Actions → **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**, or automation cannot open PRs against it. Checks on a pull request that GitHub Actions opens wait for approval: select **Approve workflows to run** in its merge box.
- [ ] Turn on code scanning. GitHub's **default setup** (Settings → Code security) is the recommended path for most projects — enable it and delete `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`. Keep that workflow only if you need a custom build or query packs, in which case configure its languages and uncomment its automatic triggers.
- [ ] Uncomment the matching ecosystem in `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- [ ] Extend `.github/workflows/lint.yml` with this project's own linters. It currently runs shellcheck and editorconfig-checker; consider making its checks required once they pass.
- [ ] Review the **Stale** policy in `.github/workflows/stale.yml`: anything quiet for 60 days is marked stale and closed 14 days later. Issues labelled `bug`, `security`, `help wanted`, `good first issue`, `in-progress`, `no-stale`, or any `priority-*` are exempt, as are pull requests labelled `in-progress` or `no-stale`. `docs/SUPPORT.md` repeats these numbers.
- [ ] Releases: pushing a tag such as `v1.0.0` publishes a GitHub release with the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as its notes (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`). It fails rather than publishing without notes if the section is missing. Add a build job there if releases should carry artifacts.
- [ ] Review `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` for this project's language.
