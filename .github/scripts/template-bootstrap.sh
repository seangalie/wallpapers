# Personalizes a repository generated from this template: replaces the
# placeholders, writes CODEOWNERS, and strips the template notices. The
# Template Bootstrap workflow runs it, and so can a person setting up the
# repository by hand (see the README). It only rewrites files in the working
# tree: it never commits, pushes, or calls GitHub.
#
# Run it from the repository root:
#   OWNER=octocat REPO=my-repo FULL_NAME="Mona Lisa" OWNER_TYPE=User \
#     bash .github/scripts/template-bootstrap.sh
#
# FULL_NAME defaults to OWNER. OWNER_TYPE is "User" or "Organization", as the
# GitHub API reports it; anything else writes a CODEOWNERS file that holds only
# instructions.
#
# With --check, it changes nothing and exits 0 if any placeholder remains, or 1
# if there is nothing left to do.
#
# Perl does the editing rather than sed, whose -i flag differs between GNU and
# macOS.
